filter
each selected in the same category (e.g., sensor1, sensor2) is OR
each category is AND

on load, go through the response, store:
a list of vehicle IDs
a list of sensor types/names(?)
plus anything else like vehicle group

user interaction process:
load map, show everything
select filters (I want to see all sensor1 trips) >> filters selected are added to store
map updates
add more filters (I want to see all sensor1 trips driven by vehicle with ID of 1234)
map updates

store:
filteredVehicleIds = ['123', '234', 2934'];
filteredSensorTypes = ['input1', 'input2', 'seatbelt'];

function:
for each filter in filterSelected, add filter:
const vehicleIdsFilter = ['any', ['==', 'vehicleId', 'smiley'], ['==', 'vehicleId', 'zigzaghamilton']];
const sensorNamesFilter = ['any', ['==', 'sensorName', 'sensor1'], ['==', 'sensorName', 'sensor2']];
this.map.setFilter('trips', ['all', vehicleIdsFilter, sensorNamesFilter]);
